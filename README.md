This Java project implements Prim's and Kruskal's algorithms for Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) and Dijkstra's algorithm for Shortest Path Tree (SPT),
alongside depth-first and breadth-first traversal methods. Users input a graph from a text file along with a starting vertex, and the program constructs the graph using adjacency lists.

It computes the MST using Prim's or Kruskal's algorithms, displays step by step processes including heap operations, and outputs the MST and SPT to the console.
